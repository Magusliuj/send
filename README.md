# How to use email to organize your ideas

Every time when I have an idea of a new project - I send email to myself, so I don't
forget it. This repository describes my way of managing ideas.

GMail will deliver mail addressed to "user+*tag*@gmail.com" as though it
were addressed to `user@gmail.com`. So, I send ideas to `anvaka+idea@gmail.com`. With
help of a filter I mark them as read, and add `Idea` label.

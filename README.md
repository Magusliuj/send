# How to use email to organize your ideas

Every time when I have an idea for a new project - I send email to myself, so I don't
forget it. This repository describes my way of managing ideas.

GMail will deliver mail addressed to "user+*tag*@gmail.com" as though it
were addressed to `user@gmail.com`. So, I send ideas to `anvaka+idea@gmail.com`. With
help of a filter I mark them as read, and add `Idea` label.

## How to bookmark an email on your phone

It depends on your phone. iPhone, unfortunately, does not let you to "pin" email to
the home screen. So I made [a website](https://anvaka.github.io/send/), that has just
one button.  When clicked - it opens your email client.

You can design the name of the button and email address. The website will give you a link
that can be added to home screen.

*Note:* The website does not track you and never sends your email anywhere. In fact,
it uses a hash tag to store your email address. Hash tags are not sent to the server,
so even GitHub will not know your email from bookmarked URL.

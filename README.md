# How to use email to organize your ideas

Every time when I have an idea for a new project - I send an email to myself, so I don't
forget it. This repository describes a quick life hack that I recently learned.

GMail will deliver mail addressed to "yourself+*tag*@gmail.com" as though it was
addressed to "yourself@gmail.com". Every time when you have a new idea, you can
just email it to yourself+idea@gmail.com. 

If you also set up GMail filters, you can mark these emails as "read" and apply labels to them:

## How to bookmark an email on your phone?

It depends on your phone. iPhone, unfortunately, does not let you to "pin" a single email to
the home screen. So I made [a website](https://anvaka.github.io/send/), that has just
one button.  When clicked - it opens your email client.

You can design the name of the button and email address. The website gives you a link
that can be added to home screen

*Note:* The website does not track you and never sends your email anywhere. In fact,
it uses a hash tag to store your email address. Hash tags are not sent to the server,
so even GitHub will not know your email from bookmarked URL.

## How to make a GMail filter

1. Open an email, and select "Filter messages like this"
2. Follow throught the screen to create a filter. Click on "Create filter with this search"
3. Select label that you want to apply
